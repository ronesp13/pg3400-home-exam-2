## Programmering i C for Linux

### Compilation
To compile the program use the `Makefile` functionality by running the following command in the terminal.

```sh
$ make
```

### Usage
The program is designed to be a CLI program.

It is assumed that all the keyfiles are located in the folder `songLibrary`.

#### Encoding
Encode a messagefile by running the command:
```sh
$ ./westergate -enc messageFile keyFile
```
The above code will result in an encoding that is vulnerable to frequency analysis, therefore, if you want
a more secure encoding, specify a `d` value. In the example below 25 is given as an example, you can input your own value. In some cases a file can not be encrypted with a `d` value.

```sh
$ ./westergate -enc messageFile keyFile -d 25
```

All output from encoding will be stored in a file named `/output/messageFile.enc.txt` 

#### Decoding
Decoding a encoded file by running the command:
```sh
$ ./westergate -dec encodedMessageFile keyFile
```

All output from decoding will be stored in a file name `/output/encodedMessageFile.dec.txt`

#### Hacking
Hack an encoded file by running the command:
```sh
$ ./westergate -hack encodedMessageFile
```

All output from hacking will be stored in a file named `output/encodedMessageFile.hax.txt`

### About the solution
When "hacking" encoded files I am assuming that all the words in the hidden message must be present in the `/usr/share/dict/words` file.
With this assumption even the smallest typo might result in a valid key being rejected. A possible solution might be to, for each key, 
keep track of a percentage of how many words matches with this key. If a key generates 80% or more correct words then there's
a reasonable chance that this key is valid.
