As he came into the window
It was the sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet

She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

Annie are you ok ?
So, Annie are you ok?
Are you ok, Annie?
Annie are you ok?
So, Annie are you ok?
Are you ok, Annie?

Annie are you ok?
So, Annie are you ok?
Are you ok, Annie?
Annie are you ok?
So, Annie are you ok?
Are you ok, Annie?

Annie are you ok?
Will you tell us that you're ok?
There's a sign in the window
That he struck you a crescendo Annie

He came into your apartment
And the bloodstains on the carpet
Then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down, it was your doom

Annie are you ok?
So, Annie are you ok?
Are you ok Annie?
Annie are you ok?
So, Annie are you ok?
Are you ok Annie?
Annie are you ok?
So, Annie are you ok?
Are you ok Annie?

You've been hit by
You've been hit by
A smooth criminal

So they came into the outway
It was Sunday, what a black day
Mouth to mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats, intimidations

Annie are you ok?
So, Annie are you ok?
Are you ok Annie?
Annie are you ok?
So, Annie are you ok?
Are you ok Annie?
Annie are you ok?
So, Annie are you ok?
Are you ok Annie?

Annie are you ok?
So, Annie are you ok?
Are you ok Annie?
So, Annie are you ok?
Are you ok, Annie?

Annie are you ok?
Will you tell us that you're ok?
There's a sign in the window
That he struck you a crescendo Annie

He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
Then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down, it was your doom

Annie are you ok?
So, Annie are you ok?
Are you ok Annie?

You've been hit by
You've been struck by
A smooth criminal

Ok, I want everybody
To clear the area right now

Annie are you ok?
(I don't know)
Will you tell us, that you're ok?
(I don't know)
There's a sign in the window
(I don't know)
That he struck you a crescendo Annie
(I don't know)

He came into your apartment
(I don't know)
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
(I don't know why baby)
Then you ran into the bedroom
(I don't know)
You were struck down
It was your doom Annie!

Annie are you ok?
(Dad gone it baby)
Will you tell us, that you're ok?
(Dad gone it baby)
There's a sign in the window
(Dad gone it baby)
That he struck you a crescendo Annie

He came into your apartment
(Dad gone it)
Left bloodstains on the carpet
Then you ran into the bedroom
(Dad gone it)
You were struck down
It was your doom Annie

Struck down, struck down
