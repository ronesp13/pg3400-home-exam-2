I'm so afraid of mistakes that I made
Taking every time that I wake
I feel like a hard-boiled butter man
So give me a time when the countries will lie on the storyline if kind 
Are days are made since the first page
I've lived every line that you wrote
Take me down, take me down, from the shelf above your head
So give me a time when the countries will lie on the storyline if kind 
And if I live on the shelf like the rest
And if love bleeds like a sad song
Please pick-up your camera and use me again
So give me a time when the countries will lie on the storyline if kind
Yea
