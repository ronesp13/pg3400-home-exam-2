Oooeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeehh 

You're a good soldier 
Choosing your battles 
Pick yourself up 
And dust yourself off 
Get back in the saddle 

You're on the front line 
Everyone's watching 
You know it's serious 
We are getting closer 
This isn't over 

The pressure is on 
You feel it 
But you got it all 
Believe it 

When you fall get up, oh oh 
If you fall get up, eh eh 
Tsamina mina zangalewa 
Cuz this is Africa 
Tsamina mina, eh eh 
Waka waka, eh eh 
Tsamina mina zangalewa 
This time for Africa 

Listen to your God 
This is our motto 
Your time to shine 
Don't wait in line 
Y vamos por todo 

People are raising 
Their expectations 
Go on and feed them 
This is your moment 
No hesitations 

Today's your day 
I feel it 
You paved the way 
Beleive it 

If you get down get up, oh oh 
When you get down get up, eh eh 
Tsamina mina zangalewa 
This time for Africa 
Tsamina mina, eh eh 
Waka waka, eh eh 
Tsamina mina zangalewa 
Anawa a a 
Tsamina mina, eh eh 
Waka waka, eh eh 
Tsamina mina zangalewa 
This time for Africa

Voice: Tsamina mina, Anawa a a

Waka waka, eh eh 
Tsamina mina zangalewa

Tsamina mina, eh eh 
Waka waka, eh eh 
Tsamina mina zangalewa 
This time for Africa 

Django eh eh

Tsamina mina zangalewa
