Oh misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brother's souls 
and should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin sons

If this is due end in fire
then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high
into the night
Calling out father, oh, 
stand by and we will 
watch the flames burn over and on the mountain side, high

and if we should die tonight
then we should all die together
raise a glass of wine 
for the last time
calling out father, oh, 
prepare as we will
watch the flames burn over and on the mountain side
desolation comes upon the sky

(Chorus)
now I see fire
inside the mountain
I see fire
burning the trees
and i see fi-i-ire
hollowing souls
and I see fi-i-i-ire
blood in the breeze
and i hope that you remember me

oh should my people fold and 
surely I'll do the same
come find in mountain holes we 
got too close to the flame
calling out father, oh, 
hold fast and we will
watch the flames watch the flames burn over and on
the mountain side
desolation comes upon the sky

(Chorus)
now I see fire
inside the mountain
I see fire
burning the trees
and i see fi-i-ire
hollowing souls
and I see fi-i-i-ire
blood in the breeze
and i hope that you remember me

and if the night is burning i will cover my eyes
for if the dark returns then my brothers will die
and as the sky is falling down it crashed into this lonely town
and with that shadow on the ground I hear my people screaming out

(Chorus)
and I see fire
inside the mountain
I see fire
burning the trees
and i see fi-i-ire
hollowing souls
and I see fi-i-i-ire
blood in the breeze

and I see fire
(oh you know I saw a city burning)
fire
and I see fire
(feel the heat upon my skin)
fire
and I see fire
(oooooh)
and I see fire burning over and on the mountain side.
